This is the official code of conduct for The Fan Club. Please read through carefully before playing.


**Welcome**
---

We're so glad that you're joining us for gameplay on our server. We've put together a list of rules and guidelines that we strongly enforce on our server, so please pay attention.

**No Griefing

While we encourage PvP and combat, lava casting and hacking are against the rules. Moderate TnT is allowed.

**No Impersonation

Impersonating a moderator will result in an immediate ban.

**Keep it Clean

Please remain kind and respectful with non crude language in public spaces such as in-game chat or out of game communication.

**No AFK over 10 Minutes

Unfortunately, our realm can only hold up to 10 people at a time. Please leave the game before going or if you're planning to go AFK for over 10 minutes.


*This rulebook will continue to be updated and changed as new objections are taken into consideration.
